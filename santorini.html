<p id = "panel1">Santorini is considered to be the most sought after place for a romantic getaway in Greece, since there are not many places in the world where you can enjoy exquisitely clear waters while perched on the rim of a massive active volcano in the middle of the sea! The island has a growing reputation as a  &quot;wedding destination&quot; for couples not only from Greece but from all over the world. A trip to Santorini with the other half is a dream for anyone who has seen at least one photo of the islands famous Caldera and exchanging kisses beneath Santorinis famous sunset is the ultimate romantic experience!</p>
<p id = "panel1">Fira is the picturesque capital of the island; perched high up on the edge of the Caldera, it looks like a marvellous painting. Fira, together with Oia, Imerovigli and Firostefani located high above on a cliff, make up the so-called  &quot;Calderas eyebrow &quot;, the balcony of Santorini, which offers an amazing view of the volcano. Other famous smaller villages are Akrotiri and Messa Vouno, with their famous archaeological sites, Pyrgos, Karterades, Emporio, Ammoudi, Finikia, Perissa, Perivolos, Megalohori, Kamari, Messaria and Monolithos.</p>
